        <p className="about-intro">
          Hi, I'm <span className="highlight">Awais Mughal</span>, a dedicated <strong>MERN Stack Developer</strong> and <strong>WordPress Expert</strong>.
          I love building responsive, secure, and modern websites using both custom code and CMS platforms.

          <h2 className="section-heading">ðŸŒŸ My Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            I believe that clean, scalable code and thoughtful UI/UX design are at the heart of every great digital product. Whether working on a full-stack JavaScript application or a CMS-driven website, my focus is always on delivering professional-grade solutions that exceed expectations.

          <h2 className="section-heading">ðŸ’» MERN Stack Development</h2>
          <p>
            As a MERN stack developer, I build modern, robust web applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. My goal is to write efficient backend APIs, craft beautiful frontends, and ensure data flows seamlessly between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            From user authentication and RESTful APIs to interactive UIs and real-time features â€” I handle it all with a focus on performance and scalability.

          <h2 className="section-heading">ðŸ§© WordPress Development</h2>
          <p>
            WordPress gives businesses the power to manage their own content with ease. I help clients harness that power by designing custom themes, integrating advanced plugins, and building responsive, SEO-optimized sites that drive engagement.
